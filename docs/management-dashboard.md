# Management dashboard

The management dashboard provides a quick, read-only snapshot of inventory coverage. It surfaces:

- Active IP count (non-archived IP assets)
- Archived IP count (soft-deleted IP assets)
- Host count
- Vendor count
- Project count

## Where to find it

Use the **Management** entry in the left navigation or visit `/ui/management`.
