# Management dashboard

The management dashboard provides a quick, read-only snapshot of inventory coverage. It surfaces:

- Active IP count (non-archived IP assets)
- Archived IP count (soft-deleted IP assets)
- Host count
- Vendor count
- Project count
- Subnet utilization (used vs. free IPs per CIDR range, with links to address lists)

## Where to find it

Use the **Management** entry in the left navigation or visit `/ui/management`.

## Reviewing free vs. used addresses

In the Subnet Utilization table, click the **Used** or **Free** counts to open the per-range
address list. The **IP Ranges** page also includes the same utilization table with the same
links for quick review.
