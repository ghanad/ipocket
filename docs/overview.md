ipocket is a lightweight, modular IP inventory web app with a simple UI and Prometheus metrics.

## MVP Goals
- Store IP records with metadata (subnet, gateway, type).
- Track ownership and project assignment.
- Make unassigned records highly visible.
- Provide Prometheus metrics for monitoring and alerting.

## Roles (MVP)

- Admin: can manage users and system settings (minimal in MVP)

## Future Phases (planned)
- Health checks (ping/80/443)
- Discovery/scanner (range scanning + NEW/GONE detection)
- Importers (CSV/API/DHCP/cloud)
- Notifications (Slack/Email)
