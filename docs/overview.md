# ipocket overview

ipocket is a lightweight IP inventory app to track addresses and their project assignment.

## Highlights
- CRUD API for IP records
- Project management
- Needs Assignment UI for project-only assignment
- Prometheus metrics on `/metrics`
- Prometheus SD endpoint on `/sd/node` with project grouping

## Note
Owner support has been removed in development phase, so assignment is now project-only.
